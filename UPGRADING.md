# Upgrading Kimai 2

Database upgrades are currently ONLY provided for MySQL/MariaDB and SQLite. 

If you plan on using e.g. PostgreSQL, please read more about the `bin/console doctrine:migrations:diff` and 
`bin/console doctrine:migrations:migrate` commands and contact us, so we can integrate them into the official releases.

## [0.3](https://github.com/kevinpapst/kimai2/releases/tag/0.3) (2018-07-22)

**Update from 0.2:**

You need to adjust your `.env` file and add your `from` address for [all emails](https://github.com/kevinpapst/kimai2/blob/master/var/docs/emails.md) generated by Kimai 2:
```
MAILER_FROM=kimai@example.com
```

Create a file and database backup before executing the following steps: 

```bash
git pull origin master
sudo -u www-data composer install --no-dev --optimize-autoloader
sudo -u www-data bin/console cache:clear --env=prod
sudo -u www-data bin/console cache:warmup --env=prod
bin/console doctrine:migrations:version --add 20180701120000
bin/console doctrine:migrations:migrate
```
