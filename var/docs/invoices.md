# Invoices

You can export your timesheet data to invoices in several formats. 

## Invoice document

The invoice system currently supports the following formats:

- `HTML`
  - through the use of Twig templates
  - filename must end with `.html.twig` 
  - Pros: no need for additional software, print or convert to PDF from your browser (if supported)
- `DOCX`
  - OOXML - Open Office XML Text
  - Microsoft Word 2007-2013 XML
  - filename must end with `.docx` 
  - Pros: simple customization and possibility to edit the invoice later on
  - our recommended invoice document format
- `CSV`
  - Comma-separated file with UTF-8 encoding and double-quotes around each field 
  - filename must end with `.csv` 
  - Pros: good for exporting and creating enhanced reports with an office software package
  - our recommended export format
- `XLSX`
  - Microsoft Excelâ„¢ 2007 shipped with a new file format, namely Microsoft Office Open XML SpreadsheetML, and Excel 2010 extended this still further with new features. 
  - file extension: filename must end with `.xlsx` 
  - PRO: good for exporting, creating enhanced reports with an office software package
- `ODS`
  - Open Document Spreadsheet or OASIS, is the OpenOffice.org XML file format for spreadsheets supported by OpenOffice, LibreOffice, StarCalc, Microsoft and others 
  - file extension: filename must end with `.ods` 
  - Pros: open format - good for exporting, creating enhanced reports with an office software package
  - our recommended spreadsheet format

**Be aware**: the default templates were created and tested ONLY with LibreOffice!

## Create your own invoice document

Invoice documents are searched in two locations:

- `templates/invoice/renderer/`
- `var/invoices/`

Be aware of the following rules:

- Documents are addressed by their filename without extension (e.g. `kimai.html.twig` results in `kimai`) 
- You can use every document name only once: so using `kimai.html.twig` and `kimai.docx` is not possible
- The first file to be found takes precedence 
- Kimai looks first in `var/invoices/`, so you can overwrite default templates
- You should store your templates in `var/invoices/` as this directory is not shipped with Kimai and not touched during updates
- You can configure different search directories through the config key `kimai.invoice.documents` if you want to 
  - hide the default templates
  - add additional template source directories
  - see below in `Configure search path` to find out how

### Twig templates

Generally speaking, you should use only the variable `model` in your template which is an instance of `App\Model\InvoiceModel`.

Please see the [default templates](https://github.com/kevinpapst/kimai2/tree/master/templates/invoice/renderer) at 
GitHub to find out which variables can be used or debug it with:

```twig
{{ dump(model) }}
```

### Docx templates

Docx templates are powered by [PHPWord](https://github.com/PHPOffice/PHPWord) and its `TemplateProcessor`.

**Important:** The variable `${entry.description}` has to be set in one table row, otherwise no timesheet records will be rendered! 
This row will then be cloned for every timesheet entry. 

See below in `Template variables` to find out which variables you can use in your template.

Find out more about PHPWord templates [here](https://phpword.readthedocs.io/en/latest/templates-processing.html).

### Spreadsheets (ODS, XLSX and CSV)

Spreadsheet templates are powered by [PhpSpreadsheet](https://github.com/PHPOffice/PhpSpreadsheet).

**Important:** within the first 100 rows you MUST-HAVE the template row for timesheet entries, which means there must be 
a value starting with `${entry.` in one of the first 10 columns, otherwise no timesheet records will be rendered!

_Check the default templates if that doesn't make sense to you ;-)_

This row will then be cloned for every timesheet entry. 

See below in `Template variables` to find out which variables you can use in your CSV file.

## Configure search path

An example config `config/packages/local.yaml` file might look like this:

```yaml
kimai:
    invoice:
        documents:
            - 'var/invoices/'
```

This would disable the default documents, as Kimai will onl look in the directory `var/invoices/` for files.
