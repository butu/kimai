# Kimai documentation

Welcome to the official Kimai v2 documentation. 

The first chapters are meant for developers and administrators:

- [Kimai configurations](configurations.md) - the Kimai core configurations, which can only be set in configuration files 
- [Developer docu](developers.md) - information for developer who would like to extend Kimai  
- [User and Security](users.md) - everything related to user and security, like authentication and roles  

The following chapters are meant for users:

- [Timesheets](timesheet.md) - information about timesheets  

We know there is a lot missing right now and would appreciate [any help](https://github.com/kevinpapst/kimai2/pulls) in writing. 
If you need information which is not available right now, [ask us](https://github.com/kevinpapst/kimai2/issues) and we 
try to add it as soon as possible.
