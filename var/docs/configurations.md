# Configurations

Configuration of Kimai is spread in all files in the `config/`directory but mainly it these files:

- `.env` - environment specific settings
- `config/packages/kimai.yaml` - Kimai specific settings
- `config/packages/admin_lte.yaml` - theme specific settings ([read more](https://github.com/kevinpapst/AdminLTEBundle/blob/master/Resources/docs/configurations.md))
- `config/packages/fos_user.yaml` - user management and email settings
- `config/packages/local.yaml` - your local configuration settings

There are several other configurations that could potentially be interesting for you in [config/packages/*.yaml](../../config/packages/).

If you want to adjust a setting from any of these files, use `local.yaml` (see below).

## Environment specific settings (.env)

The most basic settings, which need always be adjusted are stored in the `.env` file:
 
- `MAILER_URL` - smtp connection for emails
- `MAILER_FROM` - application specific "from" address for all emails
- `APP_ENV` - environment for the runtime (use `prod` if you are unsure)
- `DATABASE_URL` - database connection for storing all application data
- `DATABASE_PREFIX` - precix for any Kimai table in the configured database
- `APP_SECRET` - secret used for hasing user password (if you cahnge this, every password is invalid afterwards) 

## Overwriting local configs (local.yaml)

You can create the file `config/packages/local.yaml` and store your own settings inside. This file will NEVER be shipped with Kimai.
So having your custom settings in this file allows you to easily update Kimai. This is the same concept which is used for the `.env` file.

An example `config/packages/local.yaml` file might look like this:

```yaml
kimai:
    timesheet:
        rounding:
            default:
                begin: 15
                end: 15

admin_lte:
    options:
        default_avatar: build/apple-touch-icon.png
```

The `local.yaml` file will be imported as last configuration file, so you can overwrite any setting from the `config/packages/` directory.

After changing this file you have to clear the cache with `bin/console cache:clear` or `bin/console cache:clear --env=prod`.

## Emails (swiftmailer.yaml)

Kimai uses Swiftmailer to sent emails. You configure your SMTP connection setting in [.env](../../.env.sample). 

For more configuration details read the [Swiftmailer](https://symfony.com/doc/current/reference/configuration/swiftmailer.html) documentation 
and apply the settings in [swiftmailer.yaml](../../config/packages/swiftmailer.yaml).

## Security

Kimai uses the FOSUserBundle for security related tasks like user management. Its configuration can be found in [fos_user.yaml](../../config/packages/fos_user.yaml).

### User management emails (fos_user.yaml)

Kimai sents emails for newly registered users ([if that is configured](users.md)) and forgotten password requests. 
You can change the contents of these emails by editing [fos_user.yaml](../../config/packages/fos_user.yaml).

You can find more information in the [FOSUserBundle](https://symfony.com/doc/master/bundles/FOSUserBundle/index.html) documentation.  

### Remember me login (security.yaml)

The default period for the `Remember me` option can be changed in the config file [security.yaml](../../config/packages/security.yaml). 

## Timesheets (kimai.yaml)

### Duration only

Kimai supports two modes for displaying and recording timesheet entries:

- `begin` and `end` time (default)
- `date` and `duration` (the so called `duration_only` mode)

When activating the `duration_only` mode all timesheet tables will only display the `date` and `duration` of all records.
In addition, the "edit timesheet" forms will be changed and instead of displaying the `end` date you will see a field for `duration`.
The `start` date is only visible in these forms when editing an active or starting a new record. 

You can activate the `duration_only` mode by switching the configuration key `kimai.timesheet.duration_only` to `true` in the file [kimai.yaml](../../config/packages/kimai.yaml).

For supported formats while entering the `duration` please see the [timesheet chapter](timesheet.md) 

### Rounding of begin, end and duration for timesheet records

Rounding rules are used to round the begin & end dates and the duration for timesheet records.

1. You can define as many rules as you want ("default" is only an example)
2. Every matching rule will be applied, so be careful with overlapping rules
3. The end_date of timesheet records will be used to match the day (think about entries which are recorded overnight)
4. If you set one of "begin", "end", "duration" to 0 no rounding will be applied for that field and the exact time (including seconds) is used for calculation
5. The values of the rules are minutes (not the minute of an hour), so 5 for "begin" means we round down to the previous multiple of five
6. You can define different rules for different days of the week
7. "begin" will always be rounded to the floor (down) and "end" & "duration" to the ceiling (up)
8. Rounding rules will be applied on stopped timesheet records only, so you might see an un-rounded value for the start time and duration until you stop the record

You can configure your `rounding` rules by changing the configuration file [kimai.yaml](../../config/packages/kimai.yaml).

#### Examples

A simple example to always charge at least 1 hour for weekend work (even if you only worked for 5 minutes) could look like this:

```yaml
kimai:
    timesheet:
        rounding:
            weekend:
                days: ['saturday','sunday']
                begin: 1
                end: 1
                duration: 60
```

A rule which is often used is to round to a mulitple of 10: 

```yaml
kimai:
    timesheet:
        rounding:
            workdays:
                days: ['monday','tuesday','wednesday','thursday','friday','saturday','sunday']
                begin: 10
                end: 10
                duration: 0
```

### Hourly rates for timesheet records

If you want to apply different hourly rates multiplication `factor` for specific weekdays, you can use this `rates` configuration.

1. You can define as many rules as you want ("workdays" and "weekend" are only examples)
2. Every matching rule will be applied, so be careful with overlapping rules
3. The end_date of timesheet records will be used to match the day (think about entries which are recorded overnight)
4. "days" is an array of weekdays, where the days need to be written in english and in lowercase
5. "factor" will be used as multiplier for the applied hourly rate
6. Rate rules will be applied on stopped timesheet records only, as it can't be calculated before
7. There is no default rule active, by default the users hourly-rate is used for calculation

You can configure the `hourly_rate` rules by changing the configuration file [kimai.yaml](../../config/packages/kimai.yaml).

#### Examples

1. The "workdays" rule will use the default "hourly rate" for each timesheet entry recorded between "monday" to "friday" as a multiplication with 1 will not change the result
2. The "weekend" rule will add 50% to each timesheet entry that will be recorded on "saturdays" or "sundays"

```yaml
kimai:
    timesheet:
        rates:
            workdays:
                days: ['monday','tuesday','wednesday','thursday','friday']
                factor: 1
            weekend:
                days: ['saturday','sunday']
                factor: 1.5
```

### Timesheet - Calendar view (kimai.yaml)

The calendar view look and feel can be be configured with the config keys below `kimai.calendar`:  

```yaml
kimai:
    calendar:
        week_numbers: true
        day_limit: 4
        businessHours:
            days: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
            begin: '08:00'
            end: '20:00'
```

- `week_numbers` - whether week numbers should be displayed in the monthly view (default: true)
- `day_limit` defined the max amount of items to be displayed for one day in the monthly view (default: 4)
- `businessHours.days` defines your working days, which will be highlighted in the weekly and daily view. counting starts with sunday and the index 0, so 1 = monday, ..., 6 = saturday. (default: 1-5 / monday to friday) 
- `businessHours.begin` the start time of your working day, which will be highlighted in the weekly and daily view (default: 08:00 / 8am)
- `businessHours.end` the end time of your working day, which will be highlighted in the weekly and daily view (default: 20:00 / 8pm)

#### Integrating google calender

If you want to embed Google calendar events e.g. to display regional holidays or company partys you can import (multiple) Google calendars.

- read how to obtain your [Google API key and find the Calender ID](https://fullcalendar.io/docs/google-calendar)
- add the optional `kimai.calendar.google` configuration
- you can add any number of sources under the `kimai.calendar.google.sources` node, each must have its own name (like `holidays` and `company` in this example)

```yaml
kimai:
    calendar:
        google:
            api_key: 'your-restricted-google-api-key'
            sources:
                holidays:
                    id: 'de.german#holiday@group.v.calendar.google.com'
                    color: '#ccc'
                company:
                    id: 'de.german#holiday@group.v.calendar.google.com'
                    color: '#cc0000'
```
